If you want to have a button to save the player's name then choose the "Use Button To Save Name" folder and use that code.

But

If you want the player's name to automatically be updated every time they change it choose "Use Button To Save Name" and use that code.


Also you may need the UpdateName.cs file.

Just Apply it somewhere in the scene to change the name, then add the references to it then you will be good with that script.
